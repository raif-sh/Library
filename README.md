# Library App

A simple JavaScript library app built as part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) journey.  
This project lets you add, display, update, and remove books from a collection using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Add a new book with title, author, number of pages, and read status  
- Each book gets a **unique ID** using `crypto.randomUUID()`  
- Display all books in a neat table layout  
- Delete a book from the library  
- Toggle the read status (cycles between *want to read ‚Üí reading ‚Üí done*)  
- Modal dialog form for adding new books  
- Minimal, cozy CSS styling for a warm reading vibe
